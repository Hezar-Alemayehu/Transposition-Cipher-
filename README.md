# Transposition-Cipher-
This project implements a classical Transposition Cipher that encrypts and decrypts messages by rearranging letters based on a secret key. It converts the message into a grid, pads it if necessary, and rearranges the columns according to the alphabetical order of the key to produce the final output as a continuous string.
